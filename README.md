Netflix-autoplay-for-Chromecast
===============================

Currently it will move to the next episode, but it will not cast the tab. I'm convinced it's possible but I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

For this to work correctly you need start on the episode listing, for example: http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70185133?trkid=13462050
